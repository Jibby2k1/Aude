# Governance

## Roles
- Project Lead: owns roadmap, merges, and final decisions
- Maintainers (optional): review + merge within owned areas
- Contributors: implement issues, propose designs, write docs

## Decision Making
- Day-to-day: async in Issues/PRs
- Larger changes: use an RFC issue + decision recorded in DECISIONS.md
- If blocked: Project Lead decides after hearing input

## Meetings
- Weekly sync notes live in `docs/meetings/`
- Every meeting must end with:
  - action items (issues created)
  - owners
  - due dates
