## 2026-01-28 — Populate project charter from reference docs
**Decision:** Fill out `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` using the IEEE SPS Aude Charter reference document.  
**Context:** The repo charter template was empty; reference docs contained the authoritative details.  
**Alternatives:** Leave placeholders; create a new charter from scratch.  
**Consequences:** Charter now reflects current contributors, milestones, and goals; dates should be verified against the source if updated.  
**Links:** Proposed issue: “Populate project charter from reference docs” (resolved in main).
